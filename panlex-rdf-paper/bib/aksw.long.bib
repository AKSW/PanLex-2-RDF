  abstract = {In this paper we look into the use of crowdsourcing as a means to
	
	handle Linked Data quality problems that are challenging to be solved
	
	automatically. We analyzed the most common errors encountered in
	
	Linked Data sources and classified them according to the extent to
	
	which they are likely to be amenable to a specific crowdsourcing
	
	approach. Based on this analysis, we implemented and compared two
	
	quality assessment methods for Linked Data that leverage the wisdom
	
	of the crowds in different ways: (i) a contest format targeting an
	
	expert crowd of researchers and Linked Data enthusiasts; and (ii)
	
	paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We evaluated
	the
	
	two methods empirically in terms of their capacity to spot quality
	
	issues in DBpedia and investigated how the contributions of the two
	
	crowds could be optimally integrated into Linked Data curation
	
	processes. The results showed that the two styles of crowdsourcing
	
	are complementary, and that crowdsourcing-enabled quality assessment
	
	is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked
	
	Data sets.},

  abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured
	datasets on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality
	ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and even
	extracted data of relatively low quality. We present a methodology
	for assessing the quality of linked data resources, which comprises
	of a manual and a semi-automatic process. The first phase includes
	the detection of common quality problems and their representation
	in a quality problem taxonomy. In the manual process, the second
	phase comprises of the evaluation of a large number of individual
	resources, according to the quality problem taxonomy via crowdsourcing.
	This process is accompanied by a tool wherein a user assesses an
	individual resource and evaluates each fact for correctness. The
	semi-automatic process involves the generation and verification of
	schema axioms. We report the results obtained by applying this methodology
	to DBpedia. We identified 17 data quality problem types and 58 users
	assessed a total of 521 resources. Overall, 11.93\% of the evaluated
	DBpedia triples were identified to have some quality issues. Applying
	the semi-automatic component yielded a total of 222,982 triples that
	have a high probability to be incorrect. In particular, we found
	that problems such as object values being incorrectly extracted,
	irrelevant extraction of information and broken links were the most
	recurring quality problems. With this study, we not only aim to assess
	the quality of this sample of DBpedia resources but also adopt an
	agile methodology to improve the quality in future versions by regularly
	providing feedback to the DBpedia maintainers.},

  abstract = {Cognition is determined by function and interplay of several hundred

	and genes causing different cognitive diseases. We argue that these
	diseases should not be studied in isolation, but that data allowing
	to study them should be integrated. Ultimately, this will allow researchers
	to more easily answer questions, which would otherwise require time-consuming
	research. Specifically, we propose to use Linked Data publication,
	data integration and querying methods, which has been successfully
	used in other life science domains. In this initial effort, we converted
	12 different datasets, integrate them and provide a first demonstration
	of the added value by showing how a set of relevant queries over
	the integrated data can be answered.},

	has increased dramatically.
	
	The potential of this vast amount of data is enormous but in most
	cases it is very difficult for users to explore and use this data,
	especially for those without experience with Semantic Web technologies.
	
	Applying information visualization techniques to the Semantic Web
	helps users to easily explore large amounts of data and interact
	with them.
	
	In this article we devise a formal Linked Data Visualization Model
	(LDVM), which allows to \emph{dynamically} connect data with visualizations.
	
	We report about our comprehensive implementation of the LDVM comprising
	a library of generic visualizations that enable both users and data
	analysts to get an overview on, visualize and explore the Data Web
	and perform detailed analyzes on Linked Data.},

	is in harmonizing social care conditions and health care conditions
	with the focus on personalization and patient autonomy. Knowledge
	about the most rare diseases is limited, which is the result of poorly
	funded research and the existence of only a few specialized experts.
	Furthermore, the treatment and care of the affected patients is very
	complex, cost-intensive, time critical, and involved stakeholders
	are very heterogeneous. The information needed by the patient depends
	on his or her personal situation and constitution. To support the
	information logistics between patients of rare diseases and (all)
	other stakeholders (e.g. physicians, therapists, and researchers),
	we developed an information system with Linked Open Data technologies
	in order to create a platform and tool independent solution addressing
	the heterogeneity of the stakeholders. To engineer system and data
	model requirements of our approach we analyzed the rare disease Amyotrophic
	Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which have wide-spreaded characteristics.
	The resulting formal knowledge representation was encoded in OWL,
	which allows, for instance, a modular development of complex areas
	and also the re-usage of existing knowledge bases.},

	large amounts of structured data on the Web, mostly in the form of

	none of these tools supported a truly incremental, pay-as-you-go

	we present an approach for enabling the crowd-sourcing of the large-scale
	semantic mapping of tabular data. We devise a simple mapping language
	for tabular data, which is easy to understand even for casual users,
	but expressive enough to cover the vast majority of potential tabular
	mappings use cases. Default mappings are automatically created and
	can be revised by the community using a semantic wiki. The mappings
	are executed using a sophisticated streaming RDB2RDF conversion.
	We report about the deployment of our approach at the Pan-European
	data portal PublicData.eu, where we transformed and enriched almost
	10,000 datasets accounting for 7.3 billion triples.},

  abstract = {Up to the present day much effort has been made to publish government
	data on the Web. However, such data has been published in different
	formats. For any particular source and use (e.g. exploration, visualization,
	integration) of such information special applications have to be
	written. This limits the overall usability of the information provided
	and makes it diffcult to access information resources. These limitations
	can be overridden, if the information will be provided using a homogeneous
	data and access model complying with the Linked Data principles.
	In this paper we showcase how raw Open Government Data (OGD) from
	heterogeneous sources can be processed, converted, published and
	used on the Web of Linked Data. In particular we demonstrate our
	experience in processing of OGD on two use cases: the Digital Agenda
	Scoreboard and the Financial Transparency System of the European
	Commission.},

	We present an approach for equipping embedded and smart devices on

	The approach is based on mapping existing structured data on the device
	to vocabularies and ontologies and exposing this information as dereferencable
	RDF directly from within the device.
	
	As a result, all smart devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, TVs) can
	easily provide standardized structured information and become first
	class citizens on the Data Web.
	
	A particular specific requirement when dealing with smart and embedded
	devices are resource constraints.
	
	Our evaluation shows, that the overhead introduced by equipping a
	device with a Linked Data interface is neglectable given modern software
	and hardware environments.},

	to build a SPARQL query for querying a certain knowledge base and

	tools and services being made available.
	
	Each of the tools and services has its particular strengths and weaknesses,
	but exploiting the strengths and synergistically combining different
	tools is currently an extremely cumbersome and time consuming task.
	Also, once a particular set of tools is integrated, this integration
	is not reusable by others. We argue that simplifying the interoperability
	of different NLP tools performing similar but also complementary
	tasks will facilitate the comparability of results and the creation
	of sophisticated NLP applications.
	
	In this paper, we present the NLP Interchange Format (NIF).
	
	NIF is based on a Linked Data enabled URI scheme for identifying elements
	in (hyper-)texts and an ontology for describing common NLP terms
	and concepts.
	
	In contrast to more centralized solutions such as UIMA and GATE, NIF
	enables the creation of heterogeneous, distributed and loosely coupled
	NLP applications, which use the Web as an integration platform.
	
	We present several use cases of the second version of the NIF specification
	(NIF 2.0) and the result of a developer study.},

	to the RDF data model.
	
	LODStats is based on the declarative description of statistical dataset

	Its main advantages over related approaches are a smaller memory footprint
	and significantly better performance and scalability.
	
	We integrated LODStats with CKAN and obtained a comprehensive picture

	However, the majority of information still is contained in unstructured

	This can also not be expected to change, since text, images and videos
	are the natural way how humans interact with information.
	
	Semantic structuring on the other hand enables the (semi-)automatic
	integration, repurposing and rearrangement of information.
	
	NLP technologies and formalisms for the integrated representation
	of unstructured and semantic content (such as RDFa and Microdata)
	aim at bridging this semantic gap.
	
	However, in order for humans to truly benefit from this integration,
	we need ways to author, visualize and explore unstructured \emph{and}
	semantic information in a holistic manner.
	
	In this paper, we present the WYSIWYM (What You See is What You Mean)
	concept, which addresses this issue and formalizes the binding between
	semantic representation models and UI elements for authoring, visualizing
	and exploration.
	
	With RDFaCE and Pharmer we present and evaluate two complementary
	showcases implementing the WYSIWYM concept for different application

	Much of the corporate strategy, direction and accumulated knowledge

	semi-structured knowledge representation and sharing within organizations.
	We address challenges such as collaborative creation of presentations,
	tracking changes within them, sharing and reusing existing presentations.
	Then we present SlideWiki as a crowd-sourcing platform for the elicitation
	and sharing of corporate knowledge using presentations. With SlideWiki
	users can author, collaborate and arrange slides in organizational
	presentations by employing Web 2.0 strategies. Presentations can
	be organized hierarchically, so as to structure them reasonably according
	to their content. According to the wiki paradigm, all content in
	SlideWiki (i.e. slides, decks, themes, diagrams) are versioned and
	users can fork and merge presentations the same way as modern social
	coding platforms allow. Moreover, SlideWiki supports social networking
	activities such as following and discussing presentations for effective
	knowledge management. The article also comprises an evaluation of

	We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data
	resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality
	problems.
	
	Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated
	into concrete quality test queries.
	
	Based on an extensive literature review, we compile a comprehensive
	library of quality test patterns.
	
	The main contribution of our work is an extensive, unprecedented evaluation
	of DBpedia data quality employing our test methodology.
	
	One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific
	semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being
	able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality
	heuristics.},

  booktitle = {Submitted to 7th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing,
	September 16-18, 2013, Irvine, California, USA},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Recently, a large number of dataset repositories, catalogs and portals
	are emerging in the science and government realms. 
	
	Once a large number of datasets are published on such data portals,
	the question arises how to retrieve datasets satisfying a user's
	information need.
	
	In this article, we present an approach for retrieving datasets according
	to user queries.
	
	We define \emph{dataset retrieval} as a specialization of information
	retrieval.
	
	Instead of retrieving documents that are relevant to a certain information
	need, dataset retrieval describes the process of returning relevant
	RDF datasets.
	
	As with information retrieval, the term \emph{relevance} cannot be
	clearly defined when using traditional methods like stemming.
	
	The inherent usage of RDF in RDF datasets enables a better way of
	retrieving relevant ones.
	
	We therefore propose an additional retrieval mechanism, which is inspired
	by facet search: \emph{dataset filtering}.
	
	When querying, the entire set of available datasets is processed by
	a set of \emph{semantic filters} each of which can unambiguously
	decide whether or not a given dataset is relevant to the query.
	
	The resulting set is then given back to the requester.
	
	We implemented and evaluated our approach in CKAN, which fuels publicdata.eu
	and is the most popular data portal worldwide.},

	In order to chart the progress of both the announced policy actions
	and the key performance targets a scoreboard is published, thus allowing
	the monitoring and benchmarking of the main developments of information
	society in European countries. In addition to these human-readable
	browsing, visualization and exploration methods, machine-readable

	In particular, Semantic Web applications, which use triple stores

	the performance of relational database-backed Web applications, we
	developed an approach for improving the performance of triple stores

	selective invalidation of cache objects, following updates of the
	underlying knowledge bases, is based on analysing the graph patterns
	of cached SPARQL queries in order to obtain information about what
	kind of updates will change the query result. We evaluated our approach
	by extending the BSBM triple store benchmark with an update dimension

  abstract = {In the last years an increasing number of structured data was published
	on the Web as Linked Open Data (LOD).
	
	Despite recent advances, consuming and using Linked Open Data within
	an organization is still a substantial challenge.
	
	Many of the LOD datasets are quite large and despite progress in RDF
	data management their loading and querying within a triple store
	is extremely time-consuming and resource-demanding.
	
	To overcome this consumption obstacle, we propose a process inspired
	by the classical Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) paradigm.
	
	In this article, we focus particularly on the selection and extraction
	steps of this process.
	
	We devise a fragment of SPARQL dubbed SliceSPARQL, which enables the
	selection of well-defined slices of datasets fulfilling typical information
	needs.
	
	SliceSPARQL supports graph patterns for which each connected subgraph
	pattern involves a maximum of one variable or IRI in its join conditions.
	
	This restriction guarantees the efficient processing of the query
	against a sequential dataset dump stream.
	
	As a result our evaluation shows that dataset slices can be generated
	an order of magnitude faster than by using the conventional approach
	of loading the whole dataset into a triple store and retrieving the
	slice by executing the query against the triple store's SPARQL endpoint.},

  abstract = {Purpose - DBpedia extracts structured information from Wikipedia,
	interlinks it with other knowledge bases and freely publishes the
	results on the Web using Linked Data and SPARQL. However, the DBpedia
	release process is heavy-weight and releases are sometimes based
	on several months old data. DBpedia-Live solves this problem by providing
	a live synchronization method based on the update stream of Wikipedia.
	
	
	Design/methodology/approach - Wikipedia provides DBpedia with a continuous
	stream of updates, i.e. a stream of recently updated articles. DBpedia-Live
	processes that stream on the fly to obtain RDF data and stores the
	extracted data back to DBpedia. DBpedia-Live publishes the newly
	added/deleted triples in files, in order to enable synchronization
	between our DBpedia endpoint and other DBpedia mirrors.
	
	
	Findings - During the realization of DBpedia-Live we learned, that
	it is crucial to process Wikipedia updates in a priority queue. Recently-updated
	Wikipedia articles should have the highest priority, over mapping-changes
	and unmodified pages. An overall finding is that there is a plenty
	of opportunities arising from the emerging Web of Data for librarians.
	
	
	Practical implications - DBpedia had and has a great effect on the
	Web of Data and became a crystallization point for it. Many companies
	and researchers use DBpedia and its public services to improve their
	applications and research approaches. The DBpedia-Live framework
	improves DBpedia further by timely synchronizing it with Wikipedia,
	which is relevant for many use cases requiring up-to-date information.
	
	
	Originality/value - The new DBpedia-Live framework adds new features
	to the old DBpedia-Live framework, e.g. abstract extraction, ontology
	changes, and changesets publication.},

	approach for the development of a prosopographical knowledge base
	on the Web - the Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensis. In order to enable
	historians to collect, structure and publish prosopographical knowledge
	an ontology was developed and knowledge engineering facilities based
	on the semantic data wiki OntoWiki were implemented. The resulting
	knowledge base contains information about more than 14.000 entities
	and is tightly interlinked with the emerging Web of Data. For access
	and exploration by other historians a number of access interfaces
	were developed, such as a visual SPARQL query builder, a relationship
	finder and a Linked Data interface. The approach is transferable
	to other prosopographical research projects and historical research
	in general, thus improving the collaboration in historic research
	communities and facilitating the reusability of historic research

	questions (MCQs) are a long and widely discussed issue in the scientific
	community. However, in practice this type of questions is very popular
	due to the possibility of automatic evaluation and scoring. Consequently,
	an important research question is to exploiting the strengths and
	mitigate the weaknesses of MCQs. In this work we discuss one particularly
	important issue of MCQs, namely methods for scoring results in the
	case, when the MCQ has several correct alternatives (multiple-mark
	questions, MMQs). We propose a general approach and mathematical
	model to score MMQs, that aims at recognizing guessing while at the
	same time resulting in a balanced score. In our approach conventional
	MCQs are viewed as a particular case of multiple-mark questions,
	thus, the formulas can be applied to tests mixing MCQs and MMQs.
	The rational of our approach is that scoring should be based on the
	guessing level of the question. Our approach can be added as an option,
	or even as a replacement for manual penalization. We show that our
	scoring method outperforms existing methods and demonstrate that
	with synthetic and real experiments.},

	Systems, the collaborative, community- based creation of rich e-learning
	content is still not sufficiently well supported. There have been
	some efforts to apply the Ward Cunningham's wiki paradigm to the
	creation of e-learning content. However, the paradigm was mainly
	only applied to unstructured, textual content and can not be used
	in SCORM-compliant systems. To address the issue we develop the CrowdLearn
	concept to exploit the wisdom, creativity and productivity of the
	crowd for the creation of rich, deep-semantically structured e-learning

	content authoring with SCORM requirements for re-usability. Therefore,
	it enables splitting the learning material into Learning Objects
	(LOs) with an adjustable level of granularity. In order to realize
	the CrowdLearn concept, a novel data model called WikiApp is devised.
	The WikiApp data model is a refinement of the traditional entity-relationship
	data model with further emphasis on collaborative social activities
	and structured content authoring. We implement and evaluate the CrowdLearn

	for an open, distributed social network, which is built solely on
	Semantic Web standards and emerging best practices. Our architecture
	combines vocabularies and protocols such as WebID, FOAF, Semantic
	Pingback and PubSubHubbub into a coherent distributed semantic social
	network, which is capable to provide all crucial functionalities
	known from centralized social networks. We present our reference
	implementation, which utilizes the OntoWiki
	
	application framework and take this framework as the basis for an
	extensive evaluation. Our results show that a distributed social
	network is feasible, while it also avoids the limitations of centralized
	solutions.},

	databases.
	
	In order to link and integrate this data on the Web, it is of paramount
	importance to map relational data to the RDF data model and make
	Linked Data interfaces to the data available.
	
	We can distinguish two main approaches:
	
	First, the database can be transformed into RDF row by row and the
	resulting knowledge base can be exposed using a triple store.
	
	Second, a mapper exposes a virtual graph, based on the relational
	database and performs SPARQL-to-SQL rewriting.
	
	The key challenge of such a SPARQL-to-SQL rewriting is to create an
	SQL query which can be efficiently executed by the optimizer of underlying
	relational database.
	
	In this article we discuss and evaluate the impact of different optimizations
	on query execution time using SparqlMap, a R2RML compliant SPARQL-to-SQL
	rewriter.
	
	We also compare the overall performance with other state-of-the-art

	corpora is the disambiguation of named entities.
	
	While several approaches aim to address this problem, they still achieve
	poor accuracy on Web data.
	
	In this paper, we present AGDISTIS, a novel named entity disambiguation
	approach that performs well on Web data.
	
	Our approach combines an extension of the HITS algorithm with label
	expansion and string similarity measures.
	
	Based on this combination, it can efficiently detect the correct URIs
	for a given set of named entities within an input text. 
	
	AGDISTIS is agnostic of the underlying knowledge base and can thus
	be used on any RDF knowledge base and for any language.
	
	We evaluate our approach on three different news datasets against
	a state-of-the-art named entity disambiguation framework.
	
	Our results indicate that we outperform the state-of-the-art approach
	by up to 20\% accuracy.
	
	We also measure the effect of the structure of the underlying knowledge
	base on the accuracy of our system.
	
	Here, our results suggest that only a few RDF properties contribute
	to boosting the accuracy of the disambiguation.},

	industry, insurances etc. Such data is meanwhile available even on
	a global scale, e.g. in the Global Health Observatory (GHO) of the

	than 50 different datasets, it covers all 198 WHO member countries

	data is only accessible via complex spreadsheets and, therefore,
	queries over the 50 different datasets as well as combinations with
	other datasets are very tedious and require a significant amount
