	Abstract = {In order to reuse, link, revise or query data made available on the
	Web, it is important to know the structure, size and coverage of
	it.
	
	To achieve this, we developed and evaluated LODStats -- a statement-stream-based
	approach for gathering comprehensive statistics about data adhering
	to the RDF data model.
	
	LODStats is based on the declarative description of statistical dataset
	characteristics.
	
	Its main advantages over related approaches are a smaller memory footprint
	and significantly better performance and scalability.
	
	We integrated LODStats with CKAN and obtained a comprehensive picture
	of the current state of a significant part of the Data Web.
	
	This analysis is regularly published and enhanced over the past two
	years at the public platform stats.lod2.eu.},

@inproceedings{Kontokostas2013,
	Abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured
	data on the Web.
	
	However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively
	curated datasets to crowd-sourced or extracted data of often relatively
	low quality.
	
	In this paper we, present a methodology for test-driven data quality
	assessment, which is inspired by test-driven software development.
	
	We argue, that knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of
	test-cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality.
	
	We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data
	resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality
	problems.
	
	Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated
	into concrete quality test queries.
	
	Based on an extensive literature review, we compile a comprehensive
	library of quality test patterns.
	
	The main contribution of our work is an extensive, unprecedented evaluation
	of DBpedia data quality employing our test methodology.
	
	One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific
	semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being
	able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality
	heuristics.},

@inproceedings{Ermilov2013,
	Abstract = {The term Internet of Things refers to the vision, that all kinds of
	physical objects are uniquely identifiable and have a virtual representation
	on the Internet.
	
	We present an approach for equipping embedded and smart devices on
	the Internet of Things with a Linked Data interface.
	
	The approach is based on mapping existing structured data on the device
	to vocabularies and ontologies and exposing this information as dereferencable
	RDF directly from within the device.
	
	As a result, all smart devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, TVs) can
	easily provide standardized structured information and become first
	class citizens on the Data Web.
	
	A particular specific requirement when dealing with smart and embedded
	devices are resource constraints.
	
	Our evaluation shows, that the overhead introduced by equipping a
	device with a Linked Data interface is neglectable given modern software
	and hardware environments.},

@inproceedings{Usbeck2013,
	Abstract = {One of the key steps towards extracting RDF from natural-language
	corpora is the disambiguation of named entities.
	
	While several approaches aim to address this problem, they still achieve
	poor accuracy on Web data.
	
	In this paper, we present AGDISTIS, a novel named entity disambiguation
	approach that performs well on Web data.
	
	Our approach combines an extension of the HITS algorithm with label
	expansion and string similarity measures.
	
	Based on this combination, it can efficiently detect the correct URIs
	for a given set of named entities within an input text. 
	
	AGDISTIS is agnostic of the underlying knowledge base and can thus
	be used on any RDF knowledge base and for any language.
	
	We evaluate our approach on three different news datasets against
	a state-of-the-art named entity disambiguation framework.
	
	Our results indicate that we outperform the state-of-the-art approach
	by up to 20\% accuracy.
	
	We also measure the effect of the structure of the underlying knowledge
	base on the accuracy of our system.
	
	Here, our results suggest that only a few RDF properties contribute
	to boosting the accuracy of the disambiguation.},

@inproceedings{Brunetti2013,
	Abstract = {In the last years, the amount of semantic data available in the Web
	has increased dramatically.
	
	The potential of this vast amount of data is enormous but in most
	cases it is very difficult for users to explore and use this data,
	especially for those without experience with Semantic Web technologies.
	
	Applying information visualization techniques to the Semantic Web
	helps users to easily explore large amounts of data and interact
	with them.
	
	In this article we devise a formal Linked Data Visualization Model
	(LDVM), which allows to \emph{dynamically} connect data with visualizations.
	
	We report about our comprehensive implementation of the LDVM comprising
	a library of generic visualizations that enable both users and data
	analysts to get an overview on, visualize and explore the Data Web
	and perform detailed analyzes on Linked Data.},

  abstract = {Governments and public administrations started recently to publish
	large amounts of structured data on the Web, mostly in the form of
	tabular data such as CSV files or Excel sheets. Various tools and
	projects have been launched aiming at facilitating the lifting of
	tabular data to reach semantically structured and linked data. However,
	none of these tools supported a truly incremental, pay-as-you-go
	data publication and mapping strategy, which enables effort sharing
	between data owners, community experts and consumers. In this article,
	we present an approach for enabling the crowd-sourcing of the large-scale
	semantic mapping of tabular data. We devise a simple mapping language
	for tabular data, which is easy to understand even for casual users,
	but expressive enough to cover the vast majority of potential tabular
	mappings use cases. Default mappings are automatically created and
	can be revised by the community using a semantic wiki. The mappings
	are executed using a sophisticated streaming RDB2RDF conversion.
	We report about the deployment of our approach at the Pan-European
	data portal PublicData.eu, where we transformed and enriched almost
	10,000 datasets accounting for 7.3 billion triples.},
